# AWS PrivateLink vs. NAT Gateway Comparison

This table compares AWS PrivateLink and NAT Gateway for accessing services like Amazon ECR and ECS, focusing on cost, performance, security, and other factors.

| **Aspect** | **AWS PrivateLink** | **NAT Gateway** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Provides private connectivity to AWS services (e.g., ECR, ECS, S3) within the AWS network. | Enables internet access for private subnets to reach public AWS services or the internet. |
| **Cost (Hourly)** | ~$0.01/hour per Interface VPC Endpoint per AZ (~$7.20/month). S3 Gateway Endpoint is free. | ~$0.045/hour per NAT Gateway per AZ (~$32.40/month). |
| **Cost (Data)** | ~$0.01/GB for data processed through Interface VPC Endpoints. | ~$0.045/GB for data processed (in or out). |
| **Example Cost (3 AZs, 4GB/month)** | ~$43.84/month (2 ECR endpoints). ~$79.44/month (2 ECR + 3 ECS endpoints). | ~$99.09/month (3 NAT Gateways + 4GB data). |
| **Cost Savings** | Saves ~$55–$97/month for low data transfer (<10GB/month). Break-even at ~250GB/month. | Expensive for infrequent access due to high hourly charges. |
| **Performance** | High throughput, low latency (traffic stays in AWS network). Comparable to NAT Gateway. | High throughput (up to 100 Gbps), but traffic over public internet may add latency. |
| **Security** | Traffic stays within AWS network, reducing exposure. Fine-grained control via security groups and endpoint policies. | Traffic exits to public internet, increasing exposure. Limited destination control. |
| **Setup Complexity** | More complex: requires multiple VPC endpoints (e.g., `ecr.api`, `ecr.dkr`, S3). | Simpler: single NAT Gateway per AZ with route table updates. |
| **Use Case Fit** | Ideal for infrequent ECR pulls or ECS communication. Supports Fargate (1.4+) without ECS endpoints. | Better for high data transfer or accessing non-AWS services requiring internet. |
| **Scalability** | Auto-scales with demand. Multiple endpoints per service ensure high availability. | Scales to 100 Gbps per gateway. Multiple gateways for multi-AZ high availability. |
| **Maintenance** | Minimal: endpoints are managed by AWS. Optional endpoint policy updates. | Minimal: managed by AWS, but route table updates needed if AZs change. |
| **Additional Requirements** | S3 Gateway Endpoint (free) for ECR image layers. ECS endpoints for EC2 launch type. | Public subnet with Elastic IP for each NAT Gateway. |

## Notes

- **PrivateLink**: Best for cost savings with infrequent access (e.g., occasional ECR pulls). Enhanced security by keeping traffic private.
- **NAT Gateway**: Suitable for high data transfer or accessing external services, but costly for low usage.
- **Fargate**: With platform version 1.4+, PrivateLink requires only ECR and S3 endpoints, further reducing costs.
- **Data Costs**: PrivateLink’s lower data processing cost ($0.01/GB vs. $0.045/GB) benefits low-to-moderate data transfer.
